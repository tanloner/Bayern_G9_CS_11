Getting Started
------------
### Prerequisites
To start developing in Java or Python, you'll need to install the necessary tools. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

#### 1. Install an IDE
Begin by installing an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that suits your needs. Here are some options:

- **IntelliJ IDEA** (recommended) [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ "download")
- **Eclipse** [download](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ "download")
- **NetBeans** [download](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/ "download")
There are numerous tutorials available on how to install these IDEs, so this guide will not cover those details.

#### 2. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK)
To run and compile Java programs, you must have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download the latest version from the official Oracle website [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ "here").

When downloading the SDK, ensure you select the appropriate version for your operating system:
- Windows: Look for the "x64 Installer".
- macOS:
 - If your device has an Apple M-Series chip, choose the "ARM64 DMG Installer".
 - If your device has an Intel processor, select the "x64 DMG Installer".
- Linux: Choose the "x64 RPM Package".

#### 3. Install Python
If you're also working with Python, ensure that it's installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website:
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org "Download Python")

**Make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now."**

### Installation
The installation process may vary depending on your IDE, but the general steps are outlined below:
1. **Clone the Repository**
You can either download the project as a ZIP file or clone the repository using Git.
 - **Option 1: Download ZIP**
Download the ZIP file directly from the repository and extract it to your desired location.
 - **Option 2: Clone with Git**
To clone the repository, you can use either a Git GUI or the command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanloner/Bayern_G9_CS_11.git
```
2. **Open the Project in Your IDE**
Once you have the project files, open them in your preferred IDE.
3. **Compile the Project**
Execute the following command to compile the project:
```bash
mvn compile
```
4. **Explore and Learn**
Explore the project files and learn from the content available.

Usage
------------
The project is organized into various topics, each housed in its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find a `README.md` file that provides an explanation of the topic and the examples included.

Each topic is further divided into two subfolders:

- **Python Folder**: Contains examples and documentation in Python.
- **Java Folder**: Contains the same examples and documentation, but in Java.

For additional examples and detailed information, please refer to the [**Documentation**.](https://github.com/tanloner/Bayern_G9_CS_11/tree/master/docs "**Documentation**.")

Contributing 
------------
**CONTRIBUTING.md & guide coming soon**
Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are highly valued and **appreciated**.

If you have ideas for improvements, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement". Don't forget to give the project a star! Thank you for your support!
